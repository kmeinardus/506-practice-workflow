# 506-practice-workflow

To practice using git add, git commit, and git push, I broke down the assignment into different "commits" 
    the initial commit was creating the intro_practce.py file
    the second commit was to add a README file (i forgot to do that on the initial repository creation)
    the third commit was to import PANDAS and NUMPY
    The last commit was all the coding assignments

Provide a summary of the variables you created, an explanation of the function, and the expected output based on example data.
    I added comments as I went with the green ### for things that didn't run smoothly or that I was confused by
    For string variable I added some simple ingredients, had no issues printing the variable names
    for F string, same thing. it gave me the expected outcomes of "milk, chicken, chips" when printing the output
    the list and dictionary ran smoothly as well, when printing the outcome it gave me the expected values.

    The only issues I seemed to come across were creating funtions. I seem to be doing something wrong with the if/else statements. I specified my issues in the code with green ### comments.
        I also tried to be ambitious and create a function that calculated mean arterial pressure but failed miserably and switched to PA pressures. Id love to learn how to make more complex functions!
